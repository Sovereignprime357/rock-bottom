# BRAIN.md — Session continuity log (append-only)

## Session 2026-05-23 · v11 → v12 · wire copper, build the finisher

### WHAT
Wired the copper heist into the gameplay loop and added a cooking economy on top of it. Closes the loop: steal → sell → buy supplies → cook → smoke or sell → buy more. The "finisher move."

### WHY
v11 had the copper heist mechanically complete but gated behind rank 4 (100 cred), which meant most players never saw it. v11 also had no internal rock economy — Tony was the only source. The user explicitly asked for: wire copper stealing in, plus a self-cook + buy/sell loop. The cook loop is the late-game grind that pays off all the earlier scaffolding (Barb's packets, the crate at the block, Stripe's fence, the abandoned building).

### WHAT CHANGED

1. **Abandoned-building heist** — removed the `P.rank >= 4` gate in `interact()`. Always accessible. The Brutus Jr. dialogue is the actual gate now.
2. **`P.supplies`** — new player stat. HUD slot 🧪 added. Save schema bumped 8 → 9.
3. **BAGGIE BARB** — new vendor NPC at the laundromat (x:1540, y:1190). Uses launderlady sprite (palette-tinted). Sells $5/packet, $22/5pack. Has crossword dialogue + 14-across joke pool.
4. **`cookBatchMenu()` + `doCook()`** — 4 cook modes wired into `blockMenu`. Brain modulates outcome (`bb` factor), rocked-up subtracts 0.25 from bb (shaky scientist = comedy). 12% soap chance post-roll. Cooking 3+ at once has 35% wanted+1 (smell). All cooking is THE BLOCK only (matches smoke invariant).
5. **Stripe fence** — added "sell 1 rock $6" and "sell all (3+) bulk" options to `stripeDialogue`. Tracks `P.lifetime.rocksFenced`.
6. **Quest**: `finisher` (THE FINISHER — cook a rock).
7. **Hustles**: `cook_2`, `fence_3`.
8. **Achievements**: `chef`, `arson_of_nothing`.
9. **Lore**: news ticker, VIBE.md identity table (Barb), SPEC.md cooking table.

### DECIDED, REASONING

- **Why laundromat for Barb, not a new zone**: extending an existing space preserves the grandma-camouflage joke (she's "just doing laundry"). Less code, more comedy. Soft rule #1: prefer extending existing systems.
- **Why no rank gate on heist**: the operator's intent is "this is the finisher move." A finisher you can't unlock until rank 4 isn't a finisher, it's a treadmill reward. The Brutus Jr. encounter is the real difficulty gate and stays untouched.
- **Why brain modulates cook**: gives the player a reason NOT to smoke before cooking. Self-balancing tradeoff. Also free comedy — being rocked-up makes you a worse cook, which is true.
- **Why Stripe fences at $6 (not Tony)**: Tony does not negotiate. Stripe is the rival hustler — fencing through him is in-character. Also: he can resell at $8 with 40% soap, this fits his MO.
- **Why $5 packets / 0.08-0.55 double-rock**: economy math: avg yield per packet ~1.05-1.6 rocks depending on mode/brain. At $6 fence, that's $6.30-$9.60 revenue vs $5 cost. Always positive EV but skill-dependent. Smoking them straight makes them effectively $5 rocks (vs Tony's $10) — the real value is the rocked-up uptime.
- **Why dialogue-driven cook (not a timing minigame)**: matches the existing heist + lockpick style for consistency. Adding a third UI pattern would fragment the game's feel.

### TRIED, ABANDONED

- Considered a new NPC zone ("The Cookhouse") — overbuilt. The laundromat is funnier.
- Considered making cooking a sliding-needle skill check — would have been a third minigame pattern. Cut for consistency.
- Considered making Tony also buy rocks back at $7 — broke the "tony does not negotiate" rule and his "$10. simple math." voice. Cut.

### COUNTEREXAMPLE HUNT (gates checked)

- Cook with 0 supplies → button disabled.
- Cook with rocked-up active → bb -0.25 makes burn more likely; not broken.
- Fence rocks with 0 rocks → button disabled.
- Load v8 save → forward-compatible; `P.supplies = P.supplies || 0` post-Object.assign.
- Cooking 3+ → smell wanted bump is gated by `Math.random() < 0.35`, doesn't always trigger; doesn't run on 1-packet cooks.
- The rocked-up → crash transition is untouched. Invariant 10 preserved.

### NEXT

- Unique sprite for BAGGIE BARB (currently shares launderlady palette).
- Possible: a 4th cook mode unlocked by an item (a propane torch?) — would need a vendor for it (Pete?). On the v13 backlog as speculative.
- Boss music (still v4 backlog #11).
- Tweaker vision (v4 backlog #3) interacts well with hidden cash piles already in v11; would also work for "spot the unwatched packet" — could be a passive on Barb's cart.
- Watch for cook+smoke loop becoming too dominant in late game. If it does, slightly bump brain decay during a long rocked-up streak so the player has to sleep.

### GOTCHA

- The `state.quests.finisher` field is added to the default quests object now; old v8 saves merging into it works because `Object.assign({}, state.quests, sv.quests || {})` keeps the new default if not in the save.
- `setTimeout` on the smell wanted-bump toast: chosen so the batch toast lands first, then the consequence. Watch in case browser tab loses focus.
- `audio.glassBreak()` reused for cook complete — chiptune-appropriate but if it gets too samey, write a `audio.cook()` synth (sawtooth 200→90hz, brief). v13 polish.
